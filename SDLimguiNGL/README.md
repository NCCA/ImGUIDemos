#SDL NGL imgui
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/imgui.png)

This demo shows how to integrate the excellent [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) into NGL with a basic SDL demo.

This is still work in progress at the moment and needs some code tidy ups, all the source you need is in the repo as I have copied the main cpp / .h files from imgui into the source tree.

I may in future couple this into NGL itself as it would not take much in the way of changes.
