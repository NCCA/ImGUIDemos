# imgui demos

These demos shows how to integrate the excellent [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) into NGL with a series of demos and methods to create.

This is still work in progress at the moment and needs some code tidy ups, all the source you need is in the repo as I have copied the main cpp / .h files from imgui into the source tree.

Eventually I'm going to create an extension for NGL to have all the data types wrapped and some form of managed layer for it.
